# Annealing-Algorithms

This repo aims at collecting various annealing algorithms for future use. Each algorithm should ideally consist of:
1. A brief description of the algorithm that explains the main idea
2. Notes, including strengths/weaknesses analysis and, preferably, executable code
3. Questions
4. References

Some of the algorithms that are planned to be curated:
1. Simulated Annealing (SA)
2. Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA)
3. Thermodynamic Simulated Annealing (TSA)
4. Digital Annealing (DA)
5. Momentum Annealing (MA)
6. Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM)
